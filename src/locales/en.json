		"description": "I'm Maria Fernanda, a Systems Analysis and Development student at IFPI, passionate about technology and art. I have experience in algorithms, data structures, and logical reasoning, proven by qualifying for the National Final of the SBC Programming Marathon (2025) and working as a scientific research fellow (PIBIC/CNPq) in archaeological data collection systems. Currently, I am a fullstack intern working with the Laravel framework at AldeiaWeb, where I apply my knowledge to real projects. I am also expanding my skills in Tailwind, Java, and soft skills through Programe.IO. My passion for classical music and piano inspires discipline, attention to detail, and creativity—qualities I bring to developing innovative and efficient solutions."
